This was an assignment for my course in cryptography. Run the file main.py. 
This program contains two parts--
first, it encrypts and decrypts a string using the Caesar cypher.
Then, it performs a letter frequency analysis on a sample text file. 
You can edit the code to read any file by changing the filename it reads in line 48.
